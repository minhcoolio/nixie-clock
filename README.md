# Nixie Tube Clock Project
Summary:
This project was the perfect example of developing an embedded system from the ground up. The clock is based off of an Arduino Mega due to its large number of I/O pins, which made it ideal for driving the four nixie tubes on the clock.

Next Iteration Improvements:
Consider using a smaller Arduino and incorporating a I/O expansion board
Incorporate OOP class to organize code better
Design PCB to avoid rats nest of wires
